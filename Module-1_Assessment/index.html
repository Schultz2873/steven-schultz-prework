                                class="card-text">Hello! My name is Steven Schultz. I'm 24 years old and currently live
                            in Homewood, Illinois. I grew up on the South Side suburbs of Chicago and went to Saint
                            Laurence High School. While at Saint Laurence I was a member of the National Honor Society
                            and also
                            played baseball and football. After graduating from Saint Laurence I continued my football
                            career over
                            at Benedictine University where I majored in Computer Science.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While I attended Benedictine I juggled two jobs along with being a full time student. One as
                            a Life Cafe Supervisor at Lifetime Fitness and another as a DJ for Impulse Entertainment. I
                            got into DJing when I was around 17 and it has been a huge passion of mine ever since.
                        </p>
                        <p>After I graduated college and became a washed up collegiate athlete I've been spending my
                            free
                            time traveling, playing 16inch softball and rugby during the summer, and working on side
                            projects. One I've been working on building a web application for my DJ company that sends
                            out
                            automated text messages and emails to our clients. The other is a mobile application called
                            Spot Me, which in short, is a social media platform that will allow users to find fitness
                            classes or trainers that interest them and it allows trainers and fitness
                            instructors to promote themselves and their classes.</p>

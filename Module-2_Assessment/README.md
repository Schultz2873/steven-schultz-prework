# Introduction

This hangman game was using javascript, html and css. In order to start all just click a letter ont the screen and try to guess a word.There
are 5 words in my array and a random one will be chosen every game.

## Known Bugs

I stop the game whenever a user does not guess the word right. You will need to refresh the game. Another bus is when a user selects correct 
letter, even if it was already used, then it counts as a correct letter; however, this does not occur every time. I could not figure out exactly 
when this occurs
